# tic-tac-toe-python

Created by Richard Phan

## **Description**

This is my iteration of the game Tic-Tac-Toe, created with Python. This is also my first time experimenting with PyGame, utilizing the pygame display and such.

For the game, it is played with mouse inputs, left clicking the spaces you choose when playing. The first player is X, while the second player is O.
